This is the public GitHub repo for my online book, [**Software Containerization with Docker for Developers**](https://books.tonypujals.io/docker/)**.** This book is meant to be used with the UC Davis extension online course to be published on Coursera.

The book, this repo, and associated source code repo \([Voting App for Docker](https://github.com/subfuzion/docker-voting-app-nodejs)\) are all open source and free for any use in compliance with the terms of the [MIT License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/subfuzion/book-docker-for-developers/master/LICENSE).

To get the full benefit of these materials, I highly encourage you to take the online course when it is published \(sometime in the summer of 2018\).

If you are willing to provide feedback during the development of this book or help with the online forum when the course is ready, let me know. UC Davis is willing to provide the course for free to a limited number of volunteers.

Please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter. My account is open to direct messages.

Cheers,

Tony Pujals[ \(@tonypujals](https://twitter.com/tonypujals)\)
